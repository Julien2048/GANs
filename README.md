# Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations

This project is a part of the final year Deep Learning and Optimization at ENSAE. It is based on the research of this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456) which is summarized in this [blog](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/). We also use a part of the code of the autors presented in their [github](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/main/sampling.py)
